        <p>Fox River Food Cooperative (FRFC) is a nonprofit pre-order club based in Appleton, Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>Our mission is to bring affordable local and non-local organic food to the Fox Cities community. We believe in increased accessibility to local and organic food, and community control of food availability.</p>
        <p>Membership is open to all individuals, households/groups, and organizations. We work with suppliers to purchase food at wholesale prices and pass on the low prices to cooperative members.</p>
        <p>Instead of a traditionally hiring employees, FRFC is a worker cooperative in which each member contributes time and effort toward operation. Members have voting power and may run for election to the Board of Directors, who are the general managers of the cooperative.</p>
        <p>FRFC membership requires a monthly work requirement. The cooperative operates through shared effort by our members instead of paid employees. There are no membership dues. Individual/family and group memberships are available.</p>
