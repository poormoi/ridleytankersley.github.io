        <strong>What is FRFC?</strong>
        <p>Fox River Food Cooperative (FRFC) is a nonprofit pre-order club based in Appleton, Wisconsin whose mission is to provide affordable organic food to the Fox Cities community.</p>

        <strong>What is a co-op?</strong>
        <p>A co-op is owned and operated by its members, with no employees. FRFC members contribute time (1-3 hours per order cycle) toward operations in exchange for membership benefits.</p>

        <strong>Does it cost anything to join?</strong>
        <p>There is no fee to become a member. Anyone is free to join and order as much or as little as needed. There is a small markup per order (5% for local distributors, 10% for all others) added to the wholesale cost, which is far below retail/market prices across the board.</p>

        <strong>What kinds of products can I get?</strong>
        <p>We source from a variety of suppliers with hundreds of excellent products, including:<br />
        <ul><li>Local produce, meat, dairy, and eggs</li>
        <li>Staple foods like flour, pasta, beans, rice, spices, condiments</li>
        <li>Fair trade coffee roasted in Viroqua, Wisconsin using 100% solar power</li>
        <li>Bath and body products</li></ul></p>

        <strong>When do I get my food?</strong>
        <p>We currently operate on a 4-week order cycle. Catalogs open around the beginning of the month, are ordered 2-3 weeks later, and distributed to members at the end of the period.</p>

        <strong>How do I order?</strong>
        <p>Members place orders on a web application called Foodclub. To get started ordering, first fill out our <a href="">membership interest form</a>.</p>

        <strong>Can I stop in to browse the store?</strong>
        <p>We don't operate an open-hours grocery location, however we do have items in inventory available for purchase using the regular ordering system.</p>
